### ❓Problem Statement
 - ####  KPIs Requirement:

   We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

   <b>1. 💰 Total Revenue:</b> The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

   <b>2. 🧾  Average Order Value:</b> The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

   <b>3. 🍕 Total Pizzas Sold:</b> The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

   <b>4. 📦 Total Orders:</b> The total number of orders placed.

   <b>5. 🍽️ Average Pizzas Per Order:</b> The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
   

 
  - #### Charts Requirement:

    We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

    <b>  1. 📅 Daily Trend for Total Orders:</b>

    Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

    <b>2. ⏰ Hourly Trend for Total Orders:</b>

    Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

    <b>3. 🍕 Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:</b>

    Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall 
    sales.
 
    <b>4. 🍕📏 Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:</b>

    Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.

    <b>5.  🍽️ Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:</b>

    Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

    <b>6.  🌟  Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:</b>

    Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold.

    This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.

    <b>7. ❌ Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:</b>

    Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.

### 🧹Data Cleaning and Processing
- <b>Steps Taken:</b>
   1. Identified inconsistent entries in the <b>"pizza_size"</b> column (S, M, L, XL, XXL).
   2. Extracted the day of the week from the <b>"order_date"</b> column to analyze sales trends based on weekdays.
- <b>Issues Encountered and Resolutions:</b>
  - The values in the pizza_size column (S, M, L, XL, XXL) were updated to more descriptive names for better clarity:
<b>S → Regular,
M → Medium,
L → Large,
XL → X-Large,
XXL → XX-Large.</b>
  - Added a new column named <b>"order_day"</b> that represents the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
